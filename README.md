We rely mostly on [Astro](https://astro.build/) for building static UIs, while leveraging [React.js](https://react.dev/) and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to create some fancy animations.

Inside of the project, you'll see the following structure:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ facebook-pixel.js
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ google-analytics.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.png
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ react-components // This is where you can place your react components
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ header.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Footer.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro and React components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory(i.e scripts).
